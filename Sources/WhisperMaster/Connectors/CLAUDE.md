# Connectors

A kind (`ConnectorKind`) is a catalog entry; an instance (`ConnectorInstance`) is a
connection. The instance's `config` decides which provider serves it, and also its
auth kind and capabilities. The descriptor alone is not enough for any of these.

## Two-path kinds: Google Calendar and Outlook

Both kinds can be added through macOS Calendar (EventKit, `.calendars` config, no
credential, events only) or through the provider's own sign-in (`.googleAPI` /
`.googleOAuth`, `.microsoftOAuth`; a refreshable grant). Rules that follow:

- **Capabilities are per instance.** Outlook's descriptor says `[.events, .mail]`,
  and `ConnectorInstance.capabilities` narrows an EventKit instance to `.events`.
  If you key on `descriptor.capabilities`, `list_mail` is published with a label
  that no provider can answer.
- **"System-backed" is per instance** (`ConnectorInstance.isSystemBacked`). Only an
  EventKit instance gets "Choose calendars". When this was keyed on the
  descriptor, saving the picker on a signed-in Google Calendar rewrote its config to
  `.calendars` and silently turned it into an EventKit connection.

## Microsoft sign-in (Outlook over Graph, Teams)

- `MicrosoftOAuthConfig`: an Entra **public client**, auth code + PKCE, no secret.
  The client id is `Info.plist` `MicrosoftOAuthClientID` (env override
  `MICROSOFT_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`). **It is empty, so both stay dormant.** Outlook is
  then EventKit-only, and Teams shows "Coming soon".
- To switch it on: Entra admin center > App registrations > New registration
  ("Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts").
  Under Authentication, add the "Mobile and desktop applications" platform with the
  redirect URI `msauth.app.whispermaster.mac://auth`, and set "Allow public client
  flows" to Yes. Add delegated Graph permissions: `User.Read`, `Mail.Read`,
  `Calendars.ReadWrite`, `Chat.Read`, `ChatMessage.Send`, `offline_access`. Paste
  the Application (client) id into the plist. The client id is not a secret.
- The redirect scheme is pinned to the stable bundle id on every channel, because
  `bundle.sh` re-badges the dev id after the plist is compiled.
  `MicrosoftConnectorTests` checks that the plist declares it.
- **No scope may need admin consent.** That is why Teams is chats only: channel
  reads need `ChannelMessage.Read.All`. Teams signs in against `organizations`,
  because personal accounts have no chats in Graph.
- A refresh goes to the issuer that minted the grant. The issuer, tenant and
  requested scopes ride in the credential bag (`MicrosoftOAuthConfig.CredentialKey`),
  because the connect-time `validate` has no instance. A grant with no issuer key is
  Google, which is what every grant stored before this existed is.
- Teams has no paste path on purpose. Graph has no user-mintable token that lasts
  longer than an hour.
- `TeamsProvider.resolveChat` refuses an ambiguous name. Posting to the wrong person
  is worse than not posting.

## Slack

- Reads walk `users.conversations` (the conversations the token is a member of),
  not `conversations.list` (every public channel). With the old call, a bot hit
  `not_in_channel` on the first channels it was handed and fell back to the roster.
- `missing_scope` fails the **whole** `users.conversations` call if any requested
  type lacks its scope, so the read retries with `public_channel` alone.
  `requireSlackOK` maps `missing_scope` to `.unauthorized` (a reconnect), not to
  `.unreachable` ("couldn't read just now").
- The credential key stays `bot_token` for every token type (xoxb- or xoxp-). It is
  the Keychain key of every existing connection, so do not rename it.
- Not done: the walk is capped at 8 conversations ordered by `updated`. Slack gives
  no last-message time in that list, so a busy workspace can miss its newest
  activity. `send_message` passes the spoken channel name straight to
  `chat.postMessage`, so a DM by person name does not resolve.

## Verifying

`swift test --filter "MicrosoftConnectorTests|SlackProviderTests|Connector"`. No
test reaches the live Graph or Slack APIs. The first real sign-in after the client
id is set is the end-to-end check.
